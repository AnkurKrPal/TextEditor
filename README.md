# 🧩 Superfast Text Editor — Powered by Piece Table + AVL Tree

A **high-performance text editor** built using C++ and Qt, designed to handle large files efficiently with **instant editing** and **smooth cursor movement**.
At its core, it uses a **Piece Table** integrated with an **AVL Tree**, providing extremely fast insertions and deletions without copying large amounts of text.

## 🧠 Core Data Structure: Piece Table + AVL Tree

### 🧩 Piece Table

A **Piece Table** is a text-editing data structure that avoids moving or rewriting text.
It maintains two buffers:

* **Original buffer** — the file content loaded initially (read-only)
* **Add buffer** — new text appended during editing

Instead of editing buffers directly, it stores **pieces** referencing sections of these buffers.
Each piece keeps track of which buffer it belongs to, and the start and length of that text.

```cpp
struct pieceNode {
    BufferType source;   // ORIGINAL or ADD
    size_t start;        // start index in the buffer
    size_t length;       // number of characters
    pieceNode *left, *right;
    int weight, height;  // AVL balancing fields
};
```

This approach ensures:

* No large-scale data copying on edits
* Minimal memory usage
* Efficient support for random insertions and deletions

### 🌳 AVL Tree Integration

The Piece Table’s pieces are stored inside a **self-balancing AVL tree**:

* `weight` holds the total number of characters in the left subtree.
* Each insert/delete maintains tree balance via rotations.
* Cursor navigation, insertion, and deletion all operate in **O(log n)** time.

AVL Trees ensure the editor remains efficient even with thousands of edits:

* Keeps the height of the tree logarithmic
* Guarantees stable, predictable performance
* Supports quick traversal to locate the nth character or insertion point

## 📈 Performance Highlights

* Large files are represented compactly through references — not copied.
* Edits modify only metadata (pointers and lengths).
* Cursor movements and inserts are logarithmic in complexity.
* The AVL structure ensures consistent speed even after thousands of edits.
